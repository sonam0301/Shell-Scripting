# git Commands that I've use
.........
git clone url (will clone / download the whole repo)

git add . / filename (git will start tracking the changes and moves the files to ataging area)

git commit -m "msg" (Commited the changes to local repo)

git push (push the changes to git repu or we can say that to remote repo)

git pull (pull the changes from repo since the last clone)
.........

I've cloned the repo, and have added changed and now I want to push the changes back to github repo


# Here the the flow to follow:

1) Clone the repo using "git Clone"
2) Open the repo in VS code / any editor di the changes
3) git add . ; git commit -m "Msg telling that what you have done " ; git push
4) Changes that you made are pushed
5) On your server, do a git clone URL for the first time and from second time to test, just do a 'git pull'
